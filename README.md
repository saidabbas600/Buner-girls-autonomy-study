# Girls' Autonomy in District Buner — Mini Field Study

This repository contains the code, data, and visual analysis of a short survey conducted by two researchers to explore the autonomy of young women in District Buner, Pakistan. The study focuses on decisions around marriage, education, and political participation.

##  Context

While the sample size is small (n = 123), the findings reveal consistent patterns of male-dominated decision-making and the lack of agency in critical areas of life. This project does not claim to represent the entire region but provides a window into cultural and social dynamics that merit further research.

##  Project Structure


##  Key Findings

- Over 45% of girls were engaged while still in school
- 39% were not aware of their engagement at the time
- 37% reported education was disrupted due to marriage
- 93% had never voted, and 74% said family decides for them

##  Tools Used

- R and RStudio
- ggplot2
- RColorBrewer
- dplyr

##  Note

Due to cultural sensitivity, some respondents declined to answer. The dataset has been anonymized and generated for research presentation. This study is exploratory and encourages deeper analysis including economic and social variables.
